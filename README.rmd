# US Drug Poisoning Mortatlity by County 2003 - 2018

How have drug poisoning mortatlity rates in the US changed over recent years?

The Center for Disease Control (CDC) provides estimates for the drug poisoning mortality rates in the US on national, state and county levels (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/drug-poisoning-mortality/).

We want an effective method of displaying this data so that trends in drug mortatlities become apparent. One way to achieve this is using a choropleth (a thematic map displaying statistical information). There are many different packages capable of creating choropleths in R.

In this case we want to display the counties of the USA over a specific time period.
